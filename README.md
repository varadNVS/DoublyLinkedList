# DoublyLinkedList

This is an Interactive Doubly Linked List Created By the Author: **Varad Shirodkar**

In this We create a simple Doubly linked list and use the list Interactively to understand real time changes happeneing to the list. 
the code is divided into two parts:
1. Node Structure
2. Main Implementation of list
3. Interactive implementation

the main is where all integrates.,
tried to make this as fast as possible by using as less libraries to get optimal speed.
this is my first successfully implemented project. feel free to suggest things to improve etc..
